this is my custom build of DWM. it comes with customized source code of dwm, st, dmenu and lemonbar-xft.
you can use the `source/buildall.sh` script to automatically build and install everything. use the `installer.sh`
script if you are on arch (or any arch based system that has `pacman`).

Because this is not exactly a `project` and more of just a place to hold my configs do not expect anything to be perfect,
its unlikley I will check issues if they are made. Do remember that this is what I use on my computer daily so anything 
here is how it also is on my computer and therefore its optimized FOR ME not for you FOR ME!.

anyway. enjoy!
